# Ping-Pong-Score-Counter
This is a Code-Along from Colt Steele's Web Dev course on Udemy that I decided to do on my own when I saw the requirements. It's one of the first front-end "projects" I made since I started my Web Development journey.

The concept is simple, there are two player's playing Ping Pong. Every time someone scores you press their button to add a point. When the game finishes, the winner's score turns green, the loser's score turns red and a green setence appears to inform you of who the winner is.
Through the game settings you can change how many points a player needs to win the game, as well as the colors of the two players (Defaults are blue for player 1 and yellow for player 2). The only problem with changing the players' colors is that the hover effect is gone.
